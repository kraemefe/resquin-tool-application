### Assumptions and Goals
1. **Straightliners**: Generate lower average response times for participants flagged as straightliners (based on their standard deviations across items) with some but not much variability.
2. **Non-Straightliners**: Assign higher average response times, ensuring variability across participants.
3. **Institutional Trust Scale**: Divide straightliners into two subgroups: Fast straightliners representing the majority who has low response times and reasonable straightliners representing a smaller share with more reasonable response times.
4. **NEP Scale**: On average higher response times for the NEP scale to represent its greater length and complexity
5. **Add Realistic Noise**: Add additional random variability that mimics real-world conditions

# Assume your dataset is named 'data'
# It contains `straightlining_flag` indicating who is a straightliner.

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Define proportions for Institutional Trust Scale (Q1) straightliners
fast_straightliner_ratio <- 0.6  # 60% of straightliners are fast
reasonable_straightliner_ratio <- 0.4  # 40% of straightliners are reasonable

# Define log-normal parameters
lognormal_params <- list(
  trust_fast = list(meanlog = 1.5, sdlog = 0.3),       # Fast straightliners (shorter response times)
  trust_reasonable = list(meanlog = 2, sdlog = 0.4),   # Reasonable straightliners (moderate response times)
  trust_non_straightliners = list(meanlog = 2.5, sdlog = 0.5), # Non-straightliners

  NEP_straightliners = list(meanlog = 2.2, sdlog = 0.4), # Straightliners in NEP scale
  NEP_non_straightliners = list(meanlog = 3, sdlog = 0.5)  # Non-straightliners in NEP scale
)
